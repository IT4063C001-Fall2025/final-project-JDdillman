# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# 📝 <!-- Answer Below -->
I want to talk about cybersecurity and data privacy, specifically analyzing patterns in 
data breaches in the United States. Every year, millions of people are affected by compromised 
personal data, which can result in identity theft, financial loss, and a decline in faith in 
businesses and technology. The rise of cloud platforms, artificial intelligence, and digital 
services has led to a rise in the collection of sensitive data, but laws and safeguards are 
frequently lagging behind. This makes the topic important today. Analyzing breach trends can 
help us identify weak points and improve data security for both individuals and corporations.
